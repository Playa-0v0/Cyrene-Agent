## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Windows 10/11 (Feishu / WeChat / nut-js key-mouse automation depend on
  Win32 APIs)
- macOS / Linux may run, but desktop integration is only fully tested on
  Windows

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Playa-0v0/Cyrene-Agent.git
cd Cyrene-Agent
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

The first install downloads the Electron binary (~100 MB) along with
Pixi.js / Live2D and other rendering deps; takes 3–10 minutes depending
on network.

### 3. Build and start

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or jump straight to dev mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs `tsc` (main / preload) + `vite` + Electron concurrently. Main-process
changes auto-restart Electron; renderer changes are picked up via
Vite HMR.

## 🔑 Configure API Key

After launch, **click the system tray icon → Open Settings** and complete
the basics:

1. **🔑 API Settings**: Pick an LLM vendor preset (OpenAI / Anthropic /
   MiniMax / ...) and fill in your API Key (**required** — the agent won't
   work without it).
2. **🎙️ TTS Settings**: Pick a TTS engine (default MiniMax, or switch to
   GPT-SoVITS / Custom Cloud / MiMo).
3. **🎧 ASR Settings**: If you need voice calls, fill in Aliyun realtime
   ASR AppKey / AccessKey.
4. **📱 Phone connection** (optional): For Lark / WeChat iLink integration.

Settings are saved to `<userData>/settings.json` — no restart needed.

## ❓ FAQ

### First-launch issues (black screen, no pet, won't start)

The pet window **strongly depends** on the bundled Live2D model files.
If any of `Cyrene.model3.json` / `model.moc3` / `texture_0.png` under
`dist/renderer/public/models/cyrene/` is missing, the pet window will
show as a transparent blank window (the "black screen").

Troubleshooting:
1. **Check DevTools errors** — dev mode (`npm run dev`) opens DevTools
   automatically; in production press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Win/Linux) or
   `Cmd+Option+I` (macOS).
2. **Look for the failure log** — `[Cyrene] Failed to load model: ...`
   means `/models/cyrene/Cyrene.model3.json` wasn't bundled.
3. **Rebuild** — `npm run clean && npm run build && npm start` to regenerate
   `dist/`.
4. **Verify Vite copied assets** — file sizes under `dist/renderer/public/models/cyrene/`
   should match `src/renderer/public/models/cyrene/`.

### How to swap / add a Live2D model

**⚠️ Model path is currently hardcoded** to
`/models/cyrene/Cyrene.model3.json` (see `src/renderer/main.ts:55`),
and **there's no "switch model" UI in the settings panel yet**. So
swapping the model requires filesystem replacement + rebuild.

To swap:
1. Replace the entire `src/renderer/public/models/cyrene/` directory with
   your own Cubism 4 model:
   - `Cyrene.model3.json` (required)
   - `model.moc3` (required, model skeleton)
   - `texture_*.png` (textures)
   - `expressions/` (expression files)
   - `motions/` (motion files)
2. Run `npm run build` to let Vite copy the assets into `dist/`.
3. Restart the app.

⚠️ Honor the license terms in `MODEL_LICENSE.md` — **retain attribution
to the original creator** when swapping.

### Can I use voice call without ASR?

**No.** The voice call hard-depends on Aliyun ASR (no mic permission =
can't enter LISTENING; ASR not configured = goes straight to ERROR).

The call window has **no text input** or PTT button. All conversation
goes through mic → ASR → LLM → TTS. If you want pure text chat,
**use the chat window** (no ASR needed).

### Will it run on macOS / Linux?

**Theoretically yes, but not fully verified.** Known platform assumptions:

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 | ✅ Fully tested | Primary target |
| macOS | 🧡 Theoretically works | Electron is cross-platform; pet transparency + click-through has known Z-order quirks on macOS |
| Linux | 🧡 Theoretically works | `safeStorage` unavailable in headless; falls back to XOR obfuscation |

`game-bot`'s `nut.js` ships prebuilt binaries for all three platforms
(darwin/linux/win32 sub-packages in `package-lock.json`), but **end-to-end
testing has only happened on Windows**.

If you hit platform-specific issues on macOS/Linux, please open an issue.

### Is my API key safe?

**Chat / Vision API keys, Aliyun ASR credentials, TTS engine keys are all
stored in plain-text JSON** under `<userData>/`:

- `<userData>/model-settings.json` — LLM / Vision API key
- `<userData>/app-settings.json` — ASR / TTS / Amap / search / email passwords
- `<userData>/weixin/credentials.json` — WeChat iLink Bot credentials

**The only encrypted field**: Lark / Feishu `appSecret` (via `safeStorage` =
Windows DPAPI / macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret; falls back to XOR
obfuscation when no keyring).

**Protection relies on**: OS file permissions (`<userData>` is
current-user-only by default).

**⚠️ Don't zip / sync / share your settings directory** — your keys will
leak. To reset, delete `<userData>/model-settings.json` and
`<userData>/app-settings.json` then restart.

### OOM / memory leak troubleshooting

**No built-in memory monitoring / heap dump tools.** Common mitigations:

1. **Switch to smaller embedding model** — Settings → 🧠 Memory →
   Embedding model from `bgem3` (~570 MB) to `minilm` (~23 MB),
   saves ~550 MB.
2. **Disable reranker** — Settings → 🧠 Memory → Reranker mode = `none`,
   saves 23–279 MB.
3. **Disable external MCPs** — Settings → 🔌 Plugins, turn off
   `Playwright MCP` and `Firecrawl hosted MCP` to avoid Chromium child
   processes eating hundreds of MB.
4. **Clean up RAG documents** — Settings → 🧠 Memory → Imported docs,
   delete large files (embeddings stay in LanceDB index).
5. **Restart the app periodically** — L2 long-term memory, relationship
   log, and conflict log are push arrays with no cap; long-running
   sessions **must be restarted**.

For deep diagnostics, use Chrome DevTools Memory profiler (DevTools
opens automatically in dev mode) to grab a heap snapshot, then file
an issue with the snapshot attached.

## ✨ Features

### Core Features

#### 🪟 Desktop Companion
- **Live2D pet** — Always-on-top desktop pet powered by `pixi-live2d-display`
  + Cubism, with expression switching, mouth sync, click interaction, and
  natural idle animations.
- **Multi-window architecture** — 7 independent BrowserWindows: chat,
  sidebar, tasks, settings, sticker manager, voice call, and the pet itself.
- **AG-UI expression broadcast** — Agent uses the `play_live2d_action` tool
  to push (expression + motion + bubble) events to the pet window so the
  pet performs along with the conversation mood.

#### 💬 Conversation
- **Daily chat + voice calls** — Three switchable personality styles
  (desktop / phone / call); state machine `IDLE → LISTENING → THINKING →
  SPEAKING → ENDED`; 24-turn sliding window context.
- **Multi-chat history** — Each chat persisted as its own JSON, with
  auto-derived titles, `updatedAt` sorting, double-click rename.
- **AG-UI event stream** — Standardized events (RUN_STARTED / TEXT_MESSAGE
  / TOOL_CALL / RUN_FINISHED), per-token delta rendering.
- **Drag-and-drop file ingestion** — Drop PDF/MD/DOCX/XLSX... into the chat
  window; chunks are auto-extracted into the RAG knowledge base.
- **Sticker panel** — Built-in sticker picker; AI auto-matches the best
  sticker by reply similarity.

#### 🧠 Memory System
- **L0 core profile / L1 recent state / L2 long-term memory** — Full
  evidence chain; automatic weight decay (thresholds 60/30/10 →
  active/aging/archived).
- **Conflict detection & resolution** — Lexical candidates → RAG recall →
  scoring → resolver; resolution types cover unrelated / context_difference
  / preference_evolution / direct_conflict.
- **🧬 Custom DMAE Worldbook engine** — Markdown entry format (trigger
  words / pinned / priority / intrinsic value / linked triggers);
  activation formula `Ru = Bu × (1 + γ·ln(1+U_old))`; Active / Dormant /
  Archived state machine; one-shot cascade trigger.

#### 🔊 Voice
- **Multi TTS engines** — MiniMax / GPT-SoVITS / Custom Cloud / MiMo / off.
- **Multi ASR engines** — Aliyun realtime ASR, auto token acquisition +
  JSON protocol + raw PCM.
- **VAD silence detection** — Detects user pause during voice calls and
  auto-triggers reply.

#### 🛠 Tool Calling
- **Document generation** — Excel (`exceljs`), Word (`docx`), PDF
  (`pdfkit`), Markdown.
- **Web search / fetch** — `web_search` + `fetch_url` (turndown
  HTML→Markdown).
- **File ops** — `read_file` / `list_dir` / `write_file` / `read_image`.
- **Life utilities** — Expense ledger, exchange rate, translate, trip
  planning, unified diff apply.
- **Task delegation** — `delegate_task` (sub-agent), `todo_write`
  checklist, `ask_user_choice` user choice cards.

<summary><b>🧩 Advanced Features</b> (click to expand)</summary>

#### 📚 RAG Document Knowledge Base
- Supports txt/md/pdf/docx/xlsx/pptx/csv/json; `source: imported_doc`
  traceable.
- Hybrid retrieval: vector + BM25 + reranker (three modes: light /
  standard / none).
- Dual embedding backend: local `@xenova/transformers` + cloud
  OpenAI-compatible.
- Entity relationship graph; jieba dictionary injection prevents
  "Cyrene / 小鹿" from being split wrong.

#### 🔌 MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- stdio / SSE / HTTP transports.
- Builtin servers auto-synced; `install_mcp_server` tool lets the agent
  auto-install new servers.
- Includes Playwright + Firecrawl hosted MCP configuration.

#### 💬 External Channels
- **Lark / Feishu long-connection** — Official SDK + WebSocket (no public
  domain / intranet penetration needed); p2p chat, multi-modal text /
  image / audio / video / file / sticker.
- **WeChat iLink Bot** — `@tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin` + CLI, QR-code
  login → long-poll 35 s `getUpdates` → auto `sendText`.

#### 🤖 Game Bot Automation
- `engine.ts` step interpreter supports `launch / wait / key / click /
  vlm_click / vlm_select / vlm_check / branch` instructions.
- VLM visual localization + nut-js key-mouse input, exposed as the
  `game_bot_start` tool.

#### ✨ Skill System
- Dual-source scan: `prompts/skills/` builtin + `<userData>/skills/`
  user override (directory-level override).
- Meta tools `invoke_skill` / `read_skill_reference` with path traversal
  guard + read replay interceptor + large-text truncation.
- Supports `/skill_id ...` slash commands.
